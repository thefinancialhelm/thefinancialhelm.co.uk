        It starts slowly. The spreadsheets you built are now creaking under the strain. Small tasks, like paying a batch
        of suppliers, have become a time-consuming bottleneck. You have a nagging feeling that the numbers in your

        natural consequence of success.

          As you scale, simple tasks multiply. Manual data entry doesn't just consume timeâ€”it introduces costly errors.
          Reconciling Shopify payouts becomes a weekly headache. Instead of a clear financial picture, you're looking in
          the rearview mirror, making strategic decisions with outdated information.
